### 🚀 About Me
- 🌱 I recently graduated and am continuously sharpening my skills in **Next.js**, **React**, **PHP**, **AJAX**, **Firestore**, **Bootstrap**, **Zustand**, and **PHPOffice**.
- 💼 I’ve built practical projects like:
  - **Learning Management System (LMS)** using Next.js, Firestore, Cloudify for storage, and Zustand for state management.
  - **ChronoSchedio** — a custom scheduling system built with PHP, FullCalendar, AJAX, Bootstrap, Resend for emailing, PHPOffice for exporting/batch upload, and .htaccess for optimization.
- 📚 I love turning ideas into clean, maintainable code and exploring new technologies along the way.
